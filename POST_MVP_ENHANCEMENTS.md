# Post-MVP Enhancement Notes

## üéØ Completed in MVP
- ‚úÖ Real mistral.rs text generation with Metal acceleration
- ‚úÖ Real embedding generation with Candle
- ‚úÖ GGUF model support with Q8_0 quantization
- ‚úÖ Apple Silicon optimization (36GB on Metal)
- ‚úÖ Contract compliance and testing
- ‚úÖ Performance: ~13ms inference after warm-up

## üöÄ Post-MVP Enhancements

### 1. **App-Specific Model Storage**
**Priority: High** - Better user experience and enterprise deployment

**Current Issue:** Models stored in global HuggingFace cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/`)
- ‚ùå Survives app uninstall (leaves 25GB orphaned files)
- ‚ùå Shared between apps (cache pollution)
- ‚ùå No app control over disk usage

**Proposed Solution:**
- App-specific model directory: `~/Library/Application Support/NodeSpace/models/`
- Clean uninstall removes all models
- User transparency about storage location
- Size management under app control

**Implementation:**
- Research mistralrs custom cache directory support
- Implement manual model download if needed
- Add model management UI/CLI commands

### 2. **Model Selection & Configuration System**
**Priority: Medium** - Support multiple models and user choice

**Current:** Fixed model selection in code
**Proposed:** Runtime model switching with UI

```rust
pub enum ModelSource {
    HuggingFace(String),      // "mistralai/model"
    LocalPath(PathBuf),       // "/path/to/model"
    RemoteUrl(String),        // "https://your-server.com/model"
    Bundled,                  // Shipped with app
}
```

**Features:**
- Model selection in settings UI
- Self-hosted model support
- Bundled lightweight models for offline use
- Model switching without restart

### 3. **Self-Hosted Model Support**
**Priority: Medium** - Support custom fine-tuned models

**Requirements:**
- Host GGUF models on custom servers
- Authentication for private model repositories
- Model validation and compatibility checking
- Download progress indicators

**Use Cases:**
- Company-specific fine-tuned models
- Regulated environments requiring local hosting
- Custom domain-specific models

### 4. **Enhanced Download Experience**
**Priority: Medium** - Better user experience for large model downloads

**Current Issues:**
- No progress indication for 25GB download
- Users don't know download is happening
- No bandwidth control

**Proposed Features:**
- Download progress UI with speed/ETA
- Pause/resume downloads
- Bandwidth limiting options
- Background download with notifications

### 5. **Model Management Features**
**Priority: Low** - Advanced model lifecycle management

**Proposed Features:**
- Model cache size limits and cleanup
- Multiple model versions support
- Model performance benchmarking
- Usage analytics and recommendations

### 6. **Advanced SurrealQL Generation**
**Priority: Low** - Use real AI for SurrealQL instead of rule-based stubs

**Current:** Simple rule-based SurrealQL generation
**Proposed:** AI-powered query generation with schema awareness

**Features:**
- Schema-aware query generation
- Complex query support (JOINs, aggregations)
- Query optimization suggestions
- Natural language query explanation

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Priority

1. **App-specific storage** - Essential for production deployment
2. **Model selection system** - Important for user flexibility  
3. **Self-hosted support** - Needed for enterprise customers
4. **Download UX** - Polish for better user experience
5. **Management features** - Nice-to-have optimizations
6. **Advanced SurrealQL** - Future enhancement

## üìù Technical Notes

- Current cache location: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/mistralai--Magistral-Small-2506_gguf/`
- Model size: 25.1GB (Q8_0 quantized from 47.2GB original)
- Performance: 36GB loaded on Metal, ~13ms inference
- Apple Silicon specific optimizations working well

## üéØ Success Metrics

For post-MVP enhancements:
- Clean uninstall (no orphaned model files)
- User control over model storage location
- Support for custom/fine-tuned models
- Improved download experience (progress, pause/resume)
- Enterprise deployment ready (private model hosting)
